# Advent of Code 2021

This project contains some of the solutions for the https://adventofcode.com/2021 challenges set at Xmas 2021

Currently puzzles 18, 19, 20, 22 (part 2) and 24 are not yet solved. 
Day 23 was solved by doing the puzzle manually and not programatically (which I do hope to change at some point in the future).


All (coded) solutions are written in C#
